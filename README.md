The aim of this assignment is to design and simulate a single-ended differential amplifier which is used as an op-amp to simulate other circuits such as amplifiers, filters, oscillators, and negative differential resistance.  
The differential amplifier utilises a voltage-biased MOSFET as the common current source at the common source. It also uses other efficient techniques such as a cascode MOSFET arrangement and a cascode current mirror on the drain side.
